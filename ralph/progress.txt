# Component Conversion Progress

## Session Log

### Initial State (2026-02-02)
- Branch: ralph-setup
- Components to convert: Navbar, Pricing, FAQ, CTA, Footer
- Reference implementations: schema-hero.tsx, schema-items.tsx, schema-logos.tsx, schema-stats.tsx

### Setup Complete (2026-02-02)
- Created ralph/ directory with HITL infrastructure
- Set up eslint config in consumer-app
- Verified all feedback loops pass:
  - `pnpm build` ✓
  - `pnpm typecheck` ✓
  - `pnpm lint` ✓ (warnings only, no errors)

## Completed
(none yet)

## In Progress
(none yet)

## Blocked
(none yet)

## Decisions Made
- Use eslint with typescript-eslint, react, react-hooks, simple-import-sort, unused-imports plugins
- Warnings are acceptable, errors must be fixed before commit
- Use Sheet component for editing complex items (not Popover - better UX for multiple fields)

## Notes
- Follow the pattern established in schema-stats.tsx for complex list items
- All schema components must include VariantSelector support
- Use EDIT_CLASS and EDITING_CLASS constants consistently
- Component order: Navbar → Pricing → FAQ → CTA → Footer
